# Django full_stack Web Application

This web application was developed as part of the postgraduate course: "Distributed and Parallel Operating Systems" in order to understand the Model-View-Control architecture. The framework selected was Django due to the upcoming popularity of Python programming language. A full-stack application regarding sensor measurements for Data and Crowd Analytics. Finally, as for the front-end part of our application I have used a bootstrap template and some simple JS code for optimal user experience in order to facilitate future visualization and display of the database .

It was developed in Ubuntu 16.04.LTS, Django version 1.11 and hosted freely online.
